`cargo-delta` detects which crates in a Cargo workspace are impacted by changes in a Git feature branch. Build, test, and benchmark only the crates you need.

- **Detection Methods**: Code analysis, pattern matching and runtime heuristics.
- **Impact Categorization**: Separates crates into _Modified_, _Affected_, and _Required_.
- **Configurable**: Global and per-crate settings for parsing and detection.
- **Dual-branch Git Comparison**: Compares two branches or commits to find both modified and deleted files.
- **File Control**: Exclude files from analysis or trigger a full rebuild when critical files change.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install cargo-delta
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Analyze the baseline branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   cargo delta analyze > main.json
   ```

2. **Analyze the feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   cargo delta analyze > feature.json
   ```

3. **Compare to find impacted crates:**
   ```bash
   cargo delta run --baseline main.json --current feature.json
   ```

### CI/CD Integration

`cargo-delta` is designed to speed up PR builds by building and testing only impacted crates.
Since detection is best-effort, a **backstop build** must run separately to catch anything delta missed or was misconfigured for.

**PR pipeline** — runs delta, builds and tests only impacted crates:

```yaml
# 1. Analyze baseline (main branch)
- run: git checkout origin/main && cargo delta analyze > baseline.json

# 2. Analyze current (PR branch)
- run: git checkout $PR_BRANCH && cargo delta analyze > current.json

# 3. Determine impacted crates
- run: cargo delta run --baseline baseline.json --current current.json > delta.json

# 4. Build/test only impacted crates (use "Required" output)
- run: cargo test -p impacted-crate-a -p impacted-crate-b
```

**Backstop pipeline** — full build without delta, runs post-merge and/or on a nightly schedule:

```yaml
# Full workspace build and test, no delta
- run: cargo build --workspace
- run: cargo test --workspace
```

The backstop ensures correctness. If it fails on code that passed the delta-optimized PR build,
it indicates a gap in detection or a misconfigured delta — adjust the [configuration](#configuration) accordingly.

## Configuration

You can customize `cargo-delta` by providing a `-c config.toml` argument to the command.

```bash
cargo delta analyze -c config.toml # ...
cargo delta run -c config.toml # ...
```

Configuration options can be set globally and overridden per crate. For example:

```toml
[parser]
foo = true
foo_patterns = ["*.foo", "*.bar"]

[parser.my-crate]
foo_patterns = ["*.baz"] # Override for a specific crate
```

Default settings are provided in [`config.toml.example`](./config.toml.example).

## Detection Methods

### Module Traversal

Follows `mod` declarations and `#[path]` attributes to discover all Rust modules in the workspace.

### Mod Macros

Discovers modules declared via custom macros (e.g., `my_mod!`), assuming first argument is the name of the module.

Config default:

```toml
[parser]
mod_macros = []
```

Config example:

```toml
[parser]
mod_macros = ["my_mod"]  # my_mod!(foo)
```

### Include Macros

Detects files included via macros such as `include_str!` and `include_bytes!`, assuming the first argument is the name of the file.

Config default:

```toml
[parser]
includes = true
include_macros = [
    "include_str",   # include_str!("file.txt")
    "include_bytes"  # include_bytes!("file.bin")
]
```

### Pattern-based Assumptions

Assumes certain files are dependencies based on glob patterns (e.g., `*.proto`, `*.snap`).

Config default:

```toml
[parser]
assume = false
assume_patterns = []
```

Config example:

```toml
[parser.grpc_crate]
assume = true
assume_patterns = [".proto"]
```

### File Method Matching

Detects files loaded at runtime by matching method names (e.g., `from_file`, `load`, `open`), assuming the first argument is the name of the file.

Config default:

```toml
[parser]
file_refs = true
file_methods = [
    "file",       # ::file(path, ...)
    "from_file",  # ::from_file(path, ...)
    "load",       # ::load(path, ...)
    "open",       # ::open(path, ...)
    "read",       # ::read(path, ...)
    "load_from"   # ::load_from(path, ...)
]
```

## File Control

### File Exclusion

Exclude files and folders from analysis using glob patterns.

Config default:

```toml
file_exclude_patterns = ["target/**", "*.tmp"]
```

### Trip Wire

If any changed or deleted file matches a trip wire pattern, all crates are considered impacted.

Config default:

```toml
trip_wire_patterns = []
```


Config example:

```toml
trip_wire_patterns = [
    "Cargo.toml",       # top-level Cargo.toml
    "delta.toml"   # Delta config file
]
```

## Output

### Analyze

Analyze phase produces JSON file that's intended to be consumed by `run` phase.

- **files**: Nested tree of file dependencies as detected by all the heuristics.
- **crates**: Dependency relationships between crates within the workspace.

### Run

Run phase produces JSON file that's intended to be consumed by _your_ CI/CD.

- **Modified**: Crates directly modified by Git changes. 
- **Affected**: Modified crates plus all their dependents, direct and indirect.
- **Required**: Affected crates plus all their dependencies, direct and indirect.


## Limitations

This tool is **best-effort** and may not detect all dependencies:

- Dynamic file paths computed at runtime
- Conditional compilation dependencies
- Other dependencies not captured by the heuristics


## Example

```bash
$ cargo delta run --baseline main.json --current feature.json
Running delta..
